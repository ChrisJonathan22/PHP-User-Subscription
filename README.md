# PHP-User-Subscription

This is a subscription page which allows users to subscribe to a newsletter for example with the ability to delete users as well.

In order to run the project locally you will need a tool such as XAMPP to provide you with a Server and Database which you will need to create.

To access the live project please follow this link https://chrisjonathan.co.uk/PHP-User-Subscription/index.php.
